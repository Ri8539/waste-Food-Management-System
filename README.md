# waste-Food-Management-System
The Waste Food Management System is a web application designed to facilitate the management and redistribution of surplus food to reduce wastage. It allows users to donate excess food, find nearby donation centers, and request food donations. The system aims to bridge the gap between surplus food providers and those in need.
